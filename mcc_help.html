<h1>Medieval Calendar Calculator</h1>

<p>To see a calendar for any year or month between 500 and 1582 CE, simply enter the 
year and select the month in the navigation bar at the top of this window. Feastdays are colour-coded 
according to their liturgical rank. If you pass your cursor over a coloured day, the name
of the feast will appear on the status line at the foot of your screen.</p>

<p>This web site allows you to see the feastdays prescribed by different calendars or uses 
(e.g. different dioceses, religious orders, etc.). At the moment, the only calendars available
are a generic one (extracted from Cheney's <i>Handbook of Dates</i>) and the medieval English Hereford Use.
To see a different use, make a selection from the "Calendar" list at the upper right and click on "Load".
Once the use is loaded, you may if you wish click on the button marked "Make this your default calendar". 
If you do, your browser will a receive a cookie containing the name of your selected use, and the next time you 
visit this site that use will be loaded automatically.</p>

<p>You may create your own customised calendars in addition to the ones I've
provided. To do so, download the template and edit it to incorporate information
about the feasts of your calendar. Full instructions are provided in the template. The
template is given here as <a href="mcc_template.txt" target="top">mcc_template.txt</a>, which will appear in a new window of your browser (or right-click on the link and choose the "save as" option); you should save it, edit it with a text
editor (the Windows Notepad will do), and then give it a unique name and change its
extension from .txt to .htm. You can then load it using the "Custom" command at the
end of the list of Calendar choices and typing the address of your file. If you like, you can post it on your web site
and send me the URL; I will then add it to the list of available calendars.
In this way I hope the range of available calendars will grow in a collaborative
effort. If you don't have a web site, send me the file by email and I'll post it.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Please note</font> (10 Jan. 2001): There was an error in the instructions in the template that has now been fixed. Where it said to enter the dates of immovable feasts in the form "month, day", it should have said "day, month". If you have tried to make a template and have given up in frustration, please try again! I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>If this site does not meet all your medieval calendrical needs, try Otfried Lieberknecht's excellent <a href="http://www.lieberknecht.de/~prg/calendar.htm" target="_top">Calendar Utility</a>, where you will find indictions and year-beginning styles of every description.</p>
